# cluster-api-templates

The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of templates for
[Cluster API (CAPI)](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io) + [Talos](https://www.talos.dev).
We aim for these templates to be readily usable with only some basic preparation and environment variable setup.
Each cloud will have a README that details how to prepare and deploy the cluster.

If you find an example lacking, please reach out to us in Slack or Github to give a heads up!

Supported Templates:
- [AWS](./aws/)
